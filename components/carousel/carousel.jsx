As a friend of IIT(BHU), I very much enjoy teaching my entrepreneurship class every year to future entrepreneurs, organized by the dynamic IIT(BHU) E-Cell volunteers.

It was heartening to see how the E-Cell and the ThingQbator teams are striving to provide a platform to nurture the entrepreneurship mindset among the students. I believe that in the world of startups, there are no failures, there are successes and there are successful-failures. So, to all involved, I wish you plenty of both in the coming years.",
